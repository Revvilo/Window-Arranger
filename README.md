# Window-Arranger
AHK Based script to arrange windows quickly
The two ahk scripts in the root directory are examples that I use to arrange things on the displays.
Currently the helper library references only 3 monitors. You can use those like I have in the examples.
I will change that to a fully expandable function which just needs a number for which monitor you want when I'm not lazy.
